![GitHub Pages](../images/github_pages_572846.jpg)

After more than ten years, the time has come to move from Google's [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com) platform to a static website on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
The main reason behind this choice is my habit of using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) also to write all of my blog posts and then using an external tool to produce the HTML needed by Blogger. With Jekyll, this intermediate step is no longer needed so I can write my notes directly in Markdown, and Jekyll's builder can produce the post flawlessly.

There are many articles/posts on the web showing how the migration can be done, so it is quite pointless to repeat the steps I took to achieve the goal. Some of them are:

- [DB Tools and Cloud Ramblings](http://krisrice.io/2017-10-06-migrating-my-blog-from-blogger-to-github-pages-with-jekyll/)
- [dylan beattie dot net](https://dylanbeattie.net/2019/08/14/migrating-from-blogger-to-github-pages.html)

Enjoy
